# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Diabetic retinopathy is a severe condition commonly associated with diabetes, which can lead to permanent blindness if not detected and treated promptly. This project aims to develop a solution for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found on Kaggle at [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data). It contains a collection of retinal images labeled with the severity of diabetic retinopathy, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate system for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, ultimately reducing the risk of vision loss in diabetic patients.


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection`
3. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Set up your Python environment with the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
5. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data and the development process.
6. Experiment with different machine learning models and techniques for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy.
7. Refer to the source code in the `src/` directory for implementation details and customization.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of diabetic retinopathy detection.
